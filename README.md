# Project-Optimization-Xidian

#This is the code assignment of an optional course, w.r.t. project optimization in Xidian University.\<br>
#Consider this as a warmup for convex optimization.
Feel free to change the initial number or try different parameters.

This directory contains:
Assignmnet1:
    interpolation: using a second order function to approximately get the optimal
    bisection search: reducing half the searching area for each iteration
    golden ratio: ensure that the reduced part of the searching area is always better
Assignment2:
    gradient descent: finding the optimal on the direction of the gradient for each iteration
    conjugate gradient: using a conjugate direction p to converge to the optimal using fewer iterations
    DFP: renewing the p by renewing a Hessian matrix
